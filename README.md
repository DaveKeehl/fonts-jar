# Fonts Jar

> 💡 Save your favorite fonts so you never forget they exist.

Fonts Jar is a Chrome extension that allows you to save your favorite fonts from an always growing list of supported websites. The fonts you add to your favorites list will always be at your fingertips in the extension popup, where you can remove them, search them, filter them and group them in collections.

The goal is to support an always increasing number of websites, in order to be able to use this extension as a cross-website fonts management tool.

## ❇️ Features

- Save your favorite fonts from an always growing list of supported websites
- Search your favorites fonts
- Filter fonts by website
- Group fonts in collections

## ℹ️ How it works

Using Fonts Jar is simple! When you navigate on a supported website and you are in a font listing page, you'll see a new button that says "Add to favorites". By clicking on it, the font will be added to the list of favorites and you'll find it in the extension popup.

Once a font has been marked as favorite, you can remove it from the list by either clicking again on the button in the page (which now says "Remove from favorites"), or from the delete action in the extension.

Within the extension popup you can also search fonts by typing in the searchbar, filter them by website and group them in collections. Collections are great when you want to bind some fonts together in a logical way (e.g. variable fonts, handwritten fonts, monospaced fonts), and you can also toggle their visibility.
